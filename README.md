## Project Description

Our planet is suffering
And it’s up to us to save
To take action
We can sit down and come up with excuses, ‘what can I do?’ ‘Why do I care?’
Together we can! 
Together we will make a better future for our planet.

In the worst case scenario where we decide as species to stand idle the wildlife we love and their habitat will be destroyed, leading to mass species extinction.Superstorms, drought, and heat waves would become increasingly common and more extreme, leading to major health crises and illness. Agricultural production would plummet, likely leading to global food shortages and famine. 

We are now witnessing the huge reduction of water while hiking, the fact that we increasingly need to climb higher to find snow and more people lose their lives during heatwaves and all of this is due to 2 degrees rise in temperature.
Now imagine what our future would be if it gets worse.
Let us give the future generation a white snowy christmas.
Beaches to swim in.

A good life! 

Let’s create the best case scenario.
Let’s not be afraid that we will not have enough energy, have better agriculture, improve our health, not harm the species around us and their habitat and stop the decline of glaciers and snowlines.
The government can Keep fossil fuels in the ground. ...
Invest in renewable energy. ...
Switch to sustainable transport. ...
Help us keep our homes cozy. ...
Improve farming and harm fewer animals in the process...
Restore nature to absorb more carbon. ...
Protect forests like the Amazon. …


And what can WE do:
Save energy at home
Walk, cycle or take public transport
Eat more vegetables
Consider your travel, airplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. That makes taking fewer flights one of the fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you can, meet virtually, take a train or skip that long-distance trip altogether.
Reduce food waste
Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle
